# A Redox Layout

This is my personal layout for the `redox` keyboard. I was missing a few core functions I use on my keyboards for example media keys or Print, Delete and Insert keys.

I also extended the amount of function keys from 10 to 12 to better cover all standard function keys used in my setup.
